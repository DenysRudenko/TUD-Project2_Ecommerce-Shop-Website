Developers create e-commerce websites to provide businesses with an online platform for selling their products or services to a global audience. E-commerce websites offer several advantages over traditional brick-and-mortar stores, such as:

Increased reach: With an e-commerce website, businesses can sell their products or services to customers from all around the world.

Lower costs: E-commerce websites often have lower operating costs than physical stores, such as rent, utilities, and staffing.

Increased convenience: Customers can shop from the comfort of their own homes or on-the-go, and can easily compare prices and products.

Improved customer experience: E-commerce websites can offer a more personalized shopping experience, including product recommendations and tailored promotions.

Better data insights: E-commerce websites provide businesses with valuable data insights, such as customer behavior and preferences, which can inform future marketing and sales strategies.
